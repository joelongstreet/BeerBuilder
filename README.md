# Beer Builder

## Titanium
This project is compiled using [Appcelerator's Titanium Studio](http://www.appcelerator.com/). Appcelerator is a fickle beast and strange things can happend if you're using alternate versions of the SDK. For the best results use Titanium SDK 1.8.2.

## Compiling 
Beer Builder is written in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org). To compile and watch, cd into /BeerBuilder/Resources and run the following command:
`coffee -c -w -o lib src`
